Fabric is an open-source blockchain platform that provides blockchain services for multi-purpose distributed applications. In the context of Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Fabric provides a secure and private playing field for distributed & self-governed interaction of edge servers that are willing to share computing tasks among themselves with the intention to reduce latency and save bandwidth in the edge network. The task sharing logic is provided by: (1) smart contracts installed on the blockchain network, and (2) the integration of aditional applications that are capable to solve optimization problems and monitor the resources of the network. Fabric guarantees that all the transactions related to the task sharing service are added to an distributed ledger with tamper-proof features that enforces trust and accountability in and inherently trustless environment. Also, the membership nature of Fabric and its use of advanced cryptography help mitigate security and privacy concerns related to this collaboration scheme.

In this repository you will find the configuration files, smart contract code, and application code of a Fabric-based task sharing service demo called "EdgeChain". The main directory is broken down in three folders:

1. Task Sharing Network (fabric configuration files of the task sharing network (peers + msp + initialization + etc)

2. Smart Contracts (source code of the installed smart contracts that supports the task sharing service on the Task Sharing Network)

3. Applications (source code of the applications that supports the task sharing service on the Task Sharing Network)
